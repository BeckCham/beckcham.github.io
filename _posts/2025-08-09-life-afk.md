I was one of the committee members who restarted Aberystwyth University rowing club last September, and I've adored the experience of building the club from the ground up. We had the opportunity to take part in a league race for the first time this May, and got a team together so we could see how the progress of our club stood up.
The team was made up of 5 people, with me in the stroke and a member of the town club coxing. Our group ended up coming in first place, which was not only a great personal victory but one for the club as well.
